NARZĘDZIA SUKCESU THE LOGOTYPE FONT

This font sets a logotype on the brand's name spontaneously while typing.
It is part of a broader identity work inspired by Chevrolet Nova's
speedometer designs of the late '60s. This bit of the work is made open
as a documentation on still sparse TrueType AAT font development.


EMPIRE'S CUSTOM REVIVAL

Type used is a custom interpretation of the Empire typeface, originally
designed by Morris Fuller Benton and released under American Type
Founders in 1937. Found on various facsimiles, all needed letterforms
were translated by hand into tight and tidy TrueType curves fitting well
Empire's formal simplicity.


FONT MECHANICS

Typesetting process responds and adapts to each successively typed
letter in the 'Narzędzia Sukcesu' input stream. If you miss or mismatch
any letter in the stream, the process stops in place.

Internally these are state machines that have states chained across the
entire stream. Kerning builds from letter to letter, intervening space
gets squashed, caret adjusted and, if the string comes to an end, the
whole thing gets enclosed by the brackets.


DEVELOPMENT

The font is a TrueType font flavored with Apple Advanced Typography,
built from scratch with the OS X Font Tools.

Individual font tables are either edited directly in their respective
dumps, or are written as dedicated input files. Few tables that the
tools don't read are prepared as generic hex data in the Font Tools
syntax. Font outlines, drawn in advance in a font editor, are also
stored as such data. Those source files are all consecutively compiled
into a blank font, Null the TrueType font in particular.
