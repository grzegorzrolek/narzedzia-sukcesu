Narzędzia Sukcesu™ the logotype
===============================

These are the source files for Narzędzia Sukcesu™ logotype, part of a
brand identity work inspired by Chevrolet Nova speedometer designs of
the late ’60s. It has involved a custom drawing of the popular Empire
typeface and a scheme for the characteristic spacing that is being
applied on the fly with either AAT or OpenType, whichever is supported.


Empire
------

Empire was originally designed by Morris Fuller Benton and released
under American Type Founders in 1937. It had been digitised a couple of
times, most notably by Font Bureau, but I’d have to remake a lot of the
details anyway. In particular, the uppercase A had to be redrawn for a
more modern appearance, what would also make it more legible and the
whole rhythm more interesting. The ogonek was missing as well.

I ended up digging through ATF’s facsimiles, drawing the required
letters from scratch with all the necessary details covered. Fitting
well into Empire’s formal simplicity, the letters were also drawn
with TrueType curves exclusively.


Build
-----

The font is a TrueType font flavoured with both Apple Advanced
Typography and OpenType Layout features and is built from scratch with
Apple’s font tool suite and Adobe’s FDK. If you have both utilities
installed simply run `make` to produce the font binary.

Individual font tables are either edited directly in their respective
XML dumps or are written as dedicated input or feature files. Table
dumps are prepared in Apple’s syntax, with the few tables that the suite
does not support being prepared as generic hex table data. Note that
because of a somewhat limited `glyf` table syntax on Apple’s part, glyph
outlines are also stored in the form of hex data. Each of the source
files is then consecutively compiled into a blank font, Null the
TrueType font in particular.

The extra spacing is achieved with state machine-based positioning
having the states chained across the entire input phrase on the AAT
side, or appropriately long chaining contextual lookups on the OTL side.
